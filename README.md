I am a student of Chatra Ganeshlal High School. Which is situated in Birbhum district of the Indian state of West Bengal. 
It is really a quite good school just for it's teachers. Actually my school did'nt got any good infrustructure or support from the govt. 
Although as a begginer Web Developer I thought that I should make a website for my school, which can blow the mind of other schools as
well as the government...

So basically my goal for now is to build a basic website with no speciall webapp features. It will have a nice front end experience 
and a lots of information about the school. Then after launching it from the school, me along with a small team will convert it to 
a web app by adding some extra features on the site, like online admission, inbuild social media for school students, discussion hub 
specially for teachers or committees and some more like these.
